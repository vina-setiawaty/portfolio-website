        "projectBackground": "Cubic Rhythms began with an exploration of string-actuated cube nets, flat structures that transform into three-dimensional forms with a single pull. We were interested in this distinctly two-state mechanism, where folding and unfolding could be repurposed beyond its usual educational role to become a way of holding and releasing objects. This reminded us of marble runs, systems where marbles move through a series of interconnected paths and mechanisms, but are often experienced passively as the marble simply travels downward. What if by combining string-actuated cube nets with marble run we can make it into an interactive experience, and even make the marble move upward instead of down? Cubic Rhythms reimagines the marble run as an interactive puzzle, turning folding cube nets into a hands-on interaction to move marbles upward and challenge players to find the way to the top.",

The puzzle-solving nature of the game also promotes exploration and systems thinking." }],

While digital planning supported fast iteration, physical prototypes were necessary to validate material behaviour and mechanics. Moving between digital and physical tools allowed us to iterate efficiently while staying grounded in real-world performance."
